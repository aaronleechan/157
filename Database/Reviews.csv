55550001,11110015,"The genius is not in how much Stanley Kubrick does in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but in how little. This is the work of an artist so sublimely confident that he doesn't include a single shot simply to keep our attention. He reduces each scene to its essence, and leaves it on screen long enough for us to contemplate it, to inhabit it in our imaginations. Alone among science-fiction movies, â€œ2001"" is not concerned with thrilling us, but with inspiring our awe.",10
